# Javascript Datastructure and Algorithms
 
A nice [tutorial](https://scotch.io/courses/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-algorithms/) that I found and want to share.
Good idea, but hard to follow since is missing content.

## Reverse a string using
 
- build in methods
- build in methods ES6
- for loop
- for loop ES6
- recursive method
- reduce


## Counting vowels in a string using

- iterative approach
- regular expression


## Finding the most recurring character using

- for to iterate
- array formating


## Capitalization of the first letter of each word using

- forEach function
- map and slice methods
- map and replace


## Check if a string is palindrome using

- build in methods
- a loop and comparing characters
- a loop and comparing characters (optimized)


## Hamming distance using

- a for loop


## Finding the longest word in a sentence using

- a for loop
- reduce
- sort


## Search and replace using 

- replace
- regular expression (regex)


## Anagrams using

- direct comparasion
- character map comparison
